1. Information Flow Overview
DroneController
Input:
Commands from the AIController (e.g., hover commands, movement actions).
Manual commands from the MainWindow (e.g., emergency stop, manual control).
Output:
Drone state (e.g., position, sensor measurements) to the SLAMManager and MainWindow.
SLAMManager
Input:
Drone state (e.g., position, sensor measurements) from the DroneController.
Output:
Updated SLAM map and observation space to the AIController and MainWindow.
AIController
Input:
Observation space from the SLAMManager.
Output:
Predicted actions to the DroneController.
MainWindow
Input:
Drone state from the DroneController.
SLAM map and observation space from the SLAMManager.
Output:
Manual commands to the DroneController.
AI control toggle to the AIController.
2. Detailed Information Flow
Step 1: Drone State Updates
The DroneController continuously updates the drone's state (e.g., position, sensor measurements).
This state is sent to:
The SLAMManager for SLAM map updates.
The MainWindow for displaying the drone's current state.
Step 2: SLAM Map and Observation Space Updates
The SLAMManager receives the drone's state from the DroneController.
It updates the SLAM map and generates the observation space.
The updated SLAM map and observation space are sent to:
The AIController for AI predictions.
The MainWindow for visualization.
Step 3: AI Predictions
The AIController receives the observation space from the SLAMManager.
It uses the observation space to predict the next action.
The predicted action is sent to the DroneController to control the drone.
Step 4: GUI Interaction
The MainWindow displays the drone's state and SLAM map.
The user can:
Toggle AI control, which enables or disables the AIController.
Send manual commands (e.g., emergency stop) to the DroneController.
3. Example Workflow
Drone State Update:

The DroneController updates the drone's position and sensor readings.
This data is sent to the SLAMManager and MainWindow.
SLAM Map Update:

The SLAMManager updates the SLAM map and observation space based on the drone's state.
The updated SLAM map is sent to the MainWindow for visualization.
The observation space is sent to the AIController.
AI Prediction:

The AIController predicts the next action using the observation space.
The predicted action is sent to the DroneController.
GUI Interaction:

The MainWindow displays the drone's state and SLAM map.
The user toggles AI control, enabling the AIController to take over.
Alternatively, the user sends manual commands to the DroneController.
